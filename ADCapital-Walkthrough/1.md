# Objective
In this lab you will learn about Docker-Compose, AppDynamics Docker Visibility, and
AppDynamics Log and Transaction analytics.

## Overview
The repo contains a number of docker-compose projects that can be used to run the AD-Capital demo app with AppDynamics APM and Integrated Docker Visibility support.  The demo can be run without APM enabled (useful during development); AppDynamics APM Agents are run from a docker volume, which contains both the agent binaries and log/configuration files for each node. Separate containers are used to upload agent files and to run a Standalone Machine Agent with [Integrated Docker Visibility](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO44/Integrated+Docker+Visibility).  All the component projects are built and run using standard docker-compose commands.

Completion Time: 45 Minutes

## The App Itself
AppDynamics Transaction Analytics demo application with Docker support. This version uses [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) to build and run the application on a single docker host. The demo application shows AppDynamics APM, Transaction/Log Analytics and Docker Visibility features. See [AppDynamics/AD-Capital](https://github.com/Appdynamics/AD-Capital) for application source code. For sake of this learning lab we will be mainly using this repo
[AppDynamics/AD-Capital-Docker](https://github.com/Appdynamics/AD-Capital-Docker)

## Prerequisites
For this lab you will need [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) and docker-compose only.

If you have never heard of or used AppDynamics, I recommend the "AppDynamics 101" lab
first as this lab makes assumptions about certain aspects of AppDynamics.

## This lab will cover these main areas
1. Spinning up a distributed docker-compose application
2. Adding AppDynamics Agents to monitor the application
3. Adding the MA to enable analytics and docker visibility
4. Setting up analytics to monitor transactions and logs
